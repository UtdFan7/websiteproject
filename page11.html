        Web users are a very diverse group of people. The internet spans the globe and allows people across ages and nations to communicate and interact. Each user brings unique perspectives, histories and opinions to the worldwide forum. There are, however, some differences between the users. These differences are not limited to just location or language differences. Some web users have lives that are complicated with lifelong disabilities. These extra challenges do not stop them from getting the benefits of being connected to the digital world.
Accessibility is necessary and can be added to web functionality by means of tools, additional software or even special training. Having a disability might be an obstacle, but there are still plenty of ways to navigate the web.
Disabilities on the Web:
COGNITIVE ISSUES:
A cognitive disorder is any condition that affects how the brain functions and processes information. This can be a learning disorder like dyslexia where letters or numbers are switched, difficulty retaining memories or short attention span. Lack of concentration while using the web can make it extremely hard to focus on completing tasks. One way this can be dealt with is to avoid pages with long blocks of texts. The information—from a designer’s standpoint—should be broken up with numbers or bullets. List form articles have become extremely popular as they allow for content sharing with the risk of being bored or distracted. Captioned pictures that relate to the text are also a great way to maintain interest while staying focused.
The delivery of information is also something to consider when addressing cognitive issues. Rather than use third-party downloads, keeping the content contained in one single form will help these users concentrate. For example, having the content introduced on a webpage but needing the full file to be downloaded in a PDF can lead to straying thoughts. Consistency is also necessary—jumping from one topic to another can be frustrating and make it difficult for a user to continue to read or browse.  
VOICE DIFFICULTIES:
One of the new popular technological trends is to speak into your device. Users can give the devices commands or make inquiries. For some, this has saved them extra time from having to type out their requests or worry about spelling. Those living with conditions like AOS (apraxia of speech, where sounds become difficult to understand or words become inconsistent), tachyphemia or cluttering (speaking with increased speed, incorrect intonation and unstable rhythm) and speech sound disorder (the inability to produce viable sounds and the substitution of those sounds with others) are just a few of the speech-related problems that some users must tackle before enjoying the web.
While some are enjoying this new feature, other users might be missing out. Automated hotlines and outsourced call centers rely heavily on speech. Those users having speech disabilities will need alternative methods. There are a variety of speech conditions that need to be addressed when trying to maneuver the web. Stuttering is a commonly recognized condition that is characterized by the repetition of a single syllable, words or even phrases.
To meet the needs of users with speaking or voice impairments, advancements must be made in speech recognition programs. Websites should also never only a phone number as a means of communication. A visible and active email address is necessary to promote contact between all users.
SEIZURE TRIGGERS:
One of the things that can be found throughout web content is high energy, flashing images with lots of colors and sometimes, sounds. While these moving images can be used to create engaging and visually appealing content, they can also have negative effects. The flash motions used on websites can actually cause people to become physically ill. Vomiting, dizziness and even migraines can develop from browsing the web. The flickering content and changing colors can even cause a seizure—a mental surge of energy that the brain cannot keep pace with.
Those who are prone to fits or have epilepsy should avoid high motion and brightly lit websites. If the content has to be posted with flashing images, changing colors or blaring sounds, web designers should make sure to put a warning before the content is posted so that users can decide whether they want to risk viewing the content or not.
LIMITED HAND MOTOR SKILLS:
One of the foundations of web usage is being able to type. Searching for new music, checking emails, buying new furniture and many other tasks require the ability to be able to type your interests. But typing and using a mouse require control of fine motor skills. Fine motor skills refer to the ability for a person to use their hands to complete small, complex tasks like typing, pointing or playing instruments. For some, the act of typing can be painful because of conditions like arthritis or other pains in the joints.
Advanced features like eye-motion tracking and on-screen keyboards are ways around these troubles. Some apps even feature talk to text options that allow users to skip typing altogether and focus on merely saying what they want to search or compose in an email. Other tools like hands-free mouse tracking rely on completing commands from moving your face (i.e., opening your mouth signaling the enter key).
SIGHT HINDRANCES:
Visual conditions can range from mild to extreme, but all can affect your web usage. It is common for some users to wear glasses when browsing the web, as they might while reading a book, but this is also a sign of a mild visual disability. Site difficulties include low vision, which is the struggle to see the content or text on a screen. Struggling to decipher letters or words and being completely unable to see are issues faced by visually disabled web users. Web developers must be careful about how their codes are written to display content and text.
While it might look excellent as it was intended on one screen, viewing it at a different resolution or on a different, mobile device should not destroy the visuals. Making sure that websites have a uniform appearance across browsers is one way to ensure functionality for all users. Text should be displayed prominently or be able to have its size adjusted and overlaid on a static, non-busy background so that it can be easily read. Screen-readers and braille-keyboards are also great tools to help the visually impaired get the most of their web usage.
DIFFICULTY HEARING:
Having trouble hearing is not limited to being a consequence of listening to music or televisions at high volumes. Often, those are indicators of a hearing problem. While some hearing loss can be corrected or lessened with hearing aids, sometimes there is a complete loss of the sense (deafness).  For those who can still hear but have some difficulty perceiving sounds, there are website modifications that amplify foreground noises and separate them from background sounds.
Other ways users can experience the web while having a hearing condition is to find transcripts of the video or auditory content or choose media players that provided captioning. Sign language is also a vital element to communicating with the hearing impaired. While all those auditory disabilities do not know sign language, having a sign language visual on the page makes a difference in the experience. Rather than straining to hear, users can understand the content as it’s presented via sign language. It should also be noted that simpler texts that use illustration, graphs or other visual cues can help those who are hard of hearing.
INVOLUNTARY MOTION:
A lack of muscle control, as seen in those with total paralysis or Parkinson’s disease, can also hinder a user’s ability to use the web without obstacles. These movements are generally referred to as tremors and can be part of a disruption to a user’s experience. The movements are caused by uncontrolled and repetitive twitches in the nervous system.
Cerebral palsy is another condition marked by involuntary muscle movements that make it difficult to use the web. Those with this condition have impaired muscle coordination, balance and sometimes posture. Being unable to control your hands can make it difficult to use the web. Voice-activated controls and specialty keyboards can assist these users in getting the most of their web experiences.
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS:
The web is meant to be used and enjoyed by many people and having a disorder should not be a roadblock. A neurological disorder is any condition that is the result of an abnormality in the nervous system that limits how the brain functions. It’s important to know that these conditions are oftentimes not a reflection of a user’s intelligence—just what they can and cannot do. Mental health conditions like depression, social anxiety and delirium can all influence how a user operates the web. Rather than having to get through complicated layouts, users should be able to easily navigate a page and move between content hubs.
Websites lacking the ability to shut off animation or music present a negative and inescapable challenge. These can stimulate adverse reactions like frustration, anger and confusion. Websites that want to address these disorders will have clear navigation, options to turn off certain features and a sense of predictability regarding buttons and overall function.
