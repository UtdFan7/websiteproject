    <h3>1.2. Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully â€“ what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
    </h3>

        Digital projects are products which are developed and delivered digitally. Nowadays, it can be almost anything. A software application, a website, an online campaign, etc. What is true for digital projects is that they're virtual products delivered as a service to the client.
        <br>
        Digital projects can be managed using different project management methodologies. Agile with Scrum is a very common approach in software development, but other methods like Waterfall, PRINCE2, and Extreme Programming are similarly used when shipping digital projects. Here it is important to remember that no methodology is de facto the best. Some work better for some teams and projects, while others work better for other teams and projects. It's a matter of preference and the nature of your project.
        <br>
        A good Project Manager will be able to select and execute the right project management method for your team and type of project, but no matter the choice of methodology, most digital projects go through the same 5-steps.
        <br>
        <br>
        Scoping
        Planning
        Development
        Testing & Deployment
        Maintenance
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Scoping
        <br>
        <br>
        Scoping is the initial phase. Here you brainstorm the idea. You evaluate the options and possibilities, but also potential threats and challenges related to the idea, project, and market. Based on this assessment, you begin the initial Scoping, or Statement of Work (SOW). What needs to get done?
        <br>
        Scoping includes:
        <br>
        Ideation and brainstorming sessions with the client, requirements are defined for the implementation of the idea, and an estimation of time and costs is set up.
        <br>
        A meeting across the team, discussing the scope, milestones, and who's part of which tasks.
        <br>
        The Statement of Work is presented to the key stakeholders, incl. costs and initial requirements. If agreed, the SOW is signed by both sides, i.e., the agency and the client.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Planning
        <br>
        <br>
        After the ideation and initial scoping in the first phase, the more detailed planning can begin. You sit down with your key stakeholders once again and discuss the functionality, requirements, and the roadmap to get there. The creative process is initiated. The user experience begins its formation using Wireframes, User Journeys, and Information Architecture to define the structure of content. This part of the process is often a collaboration between the teams of, User Experience (UX), Design, Marketing, and Development.
        <br>
        Planning includes:
        <br>    
        A detailed plan for the implementation of the idea is laid out and put into an agreed roadmap.
        <br>
        Creative teams are engaged, and the consumer's user experience is initiated and designed.
        <br>
        Requirements and design guidelines are handed over to Development in the next phase.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Development
        <br>
        <br>
        Requirements and the rough design specifications should now be in place and handed over to the Development team. The implementation can now begin. The development process will follow a natural progression from back-end to front-end, and refinements of each. The back-end setup is crucial as a foundation for the following development and end experience.
        <br>
        Alpha and Beta versions of the final product will often be directly reflected as milestones in the roadmap and work as the natural progression towards Testing & Deployment.
        <br>
        Development includes:
        <br>
        Back-end development of the architecture supporting the development and final product can begin.
        <br>
        Alpha and Beta versions build on top of the back-end, and the final design specifications are implemented to the front-end.
        <br>
        Key stakeholders are brought in again: Revisions and polishing is done in collaboration with the client. Feedback is taken in, and adjustments are made.
        <br>
        Final touches are made to get ready for Testing & Deployment.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Testing & Deployment
        <br>
        <br>
        Deployment is the final stage before the product will be in the hands of the end-user. It might sound simple, but Deployment is a crucial step. Everything needs to be tested and various use-cases must be taken into account. Quality Assessment (QA) of the code and final product is conducted, and the project goes live and is made available to the public.
        <br>
        Testing & Deployment includes:
        <br>
        Testing of the code and use-cases. Were all requirements and specifications implemented successfully?
        <br>
        Quality Assessment (QA) conducts an analysis of the final product before it is pushed live.
        <br>
        Product is deployed and goes live.
        <br>
        The project transforms into the Maintenance phase.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Maintenance
        <br>
        <br>
        After the product has been delivered, the Maintenance phase will take over. Maintenance is a continuous phase of improving functionality, stability, and offering support of the product. Depending on the nature of your project, further development may also be part of the current project or evolve into a second continuous project.
        <br>
        Maintenance includes:
        <br>
        Improvement of functionality and bug fixing
        <br>
        Addressing stability issues and keeping the system running
        <br>
        Support of the product
