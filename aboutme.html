    <h2>about me.</h2>
    <p class= "medium"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by computers and their capabilities since I was a young boy. From the very first time I switched on my sister’s Amstrad CPC 464 and I saw the monitor screen light up green and bits of coding move up the left side of the screen, from then on I was hooked. When she first introduced me to “Pong” on her Atari computer, it blew my mind as a young boy.
    <br>
    <br>
    As a teenager my love for computers grew and I began learning how to create websites in Notepad on a PC, as well as building PC’s from scratch and gaining qualifications in GCSE IT, CLAIT, IBT 2, IBT 3 and ECDL. As a young adult I then decided to pursue a BTEC National Diploma in Multimedia Arts, which linked my passion for design and computers. I then went onto study at the Liverpool School of Art & Design. It was while studying the BTEC and Degree in Graphic Design I learnt about Adobe Creative Suite (Now replaced by Adobe Cloud). Learning Adobe Creative Suite gave me a good understanding about various programmes namely Flash, Premier Pro, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Photoshop, After Effects to name but a few. I also taught myself Cinema 4D, Stop Motion Studio, Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, as animation, film and music are also great passions of mine.

    I decided to come to Code Nation as I read one of their flyers in the work zone in Ellesmere Port and I was fascinated straight away, I wanted in! It felt like a Eureka / Light Bulb moment as It combines creativity and analytical skills perfectly. It's for the detail-orientated and those with an eye for design, that’s why I hope that I can get onto the Masterclass, I think it would be a perfect fit for me.

    <br>
    The experience at Code Nation thus far has been great. My tutor Liam is very knowledgeable, friendly, easily approachable and explains everything in a clear and concise manner. He is very understanding and empathetic towards me as I have lost a couple of relatives while on the course, I also have dyslexia and I need to have things explained clearly in class. Liam is a credit to Code Nation.
