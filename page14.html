    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h3>
    <p class= "small"></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The tools used, namely Visual Studio Code and Trello were appropriate for the task, working alongside each other. Trello was utilised for its planning capabilities and Visual Studio Code for the actual designing of the website using html and css. Trello helped me have better organisation of the task in hand, as I could see what tasks needed to be done in a clearer way which helped with my dyslexia. Visual Studio Code also helped in this sense as everything was clearly laid out and navigation around the programme was easy for me.
