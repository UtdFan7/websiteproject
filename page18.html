Visual Studio Code Benefits - 

Intelli-Sense - It can detect if any snippet of code is left incomplete. Also, common variable syntaxes and variable declarations are made automatically.
Cross-Platform Support - Visual Studio Code is cross-platform. It can work on all three platforms. Also, the code works on all three platforms, else, the open-source and proprietary software codes used to be different.
Repository - With ever-increasing demand of the code, secure and timely storage is equally important. Visual Studio Code is connected with Git or can be connected with any other repository for pulling or saving the instances.

Git Support - Resources can be pulled from Git Hub Repo online and vice-versa; saving can be done too. Resource pulling also means to clone the code which is made available on the internet. This code can later be changed and saved.
Commenting - A common feature, but some of the languages do not support it. Commenting the code helps the user to recall or track according to the sequence he wants.
As well as these benefits Visual Studio Code is clear and concise in its layout, user friendly, for a person with dyslexia it is great, not only that it is a free programme unlike Dreamweaver.
Visual Studio Code Drawbacks -

Different layout to Dreamweaver which I’m not used to. Although Visual Studio Code is fairly simple to use, it did take me time navigating and getting used to were things were within the programme.

I could have been more efficient in the designing and making of my website by being better organised and methodical in my approach, creating sketchbooks containing primiliminary ideas, research, visuals, texts etc etc. I could have created even more detailed tabs in Trello, scheduling tasks into even finer details than normal. By being more organised and methodical overall I could have allowed the same time and effort into both the designing and the actual making process. With regards to the project as well as the course as a whole, with losing two relatives within the space of two weeks while on the course, it has shocked me somewhat and affected my focus, concentration, motivation as well as my design flair.Working in a team might have improved efficiency, by giving out jobs to people who specialise in certain areas then I get to work on a particular area I have a specialised skill in. Slack could have also been used as a means of communication between team members if I decided to work collaboratively, by emailing each other snippets of research interest to look over / ideas while at home, so every bit of time is used productively.
