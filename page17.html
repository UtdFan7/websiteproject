        2.1  preparing appropriate content for your site 

In order to prepare appropriate content for my site, very detailed research would have to be undertaken. I would do this by creating sketchbooks containing primiliminary ideas, research, visuals, texts etc etc. I would also produce a blog of my findings on the computer, by doing this I then could include any film / music research I feel would be beneficial for generating ideas for my final piece of work.


2.5 changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site

In order for the website to look aesthetically pleasing to the viewer and to break up big chunks of text on a website, imagery is used as a design tool. For the imagery to be effective correct file formats should be followed. 

JPEG - These are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative effect on pagespeed.

 
PNG - They are not just suitable for images, but also graphics and text. PNGs also give you control over transparency, unlike JPEGs, which makes them pretty much perfect for logos. PNGs also use a lossless compression, meaning they don’t lose any information or quality.

GIF - They tend to be much smaller file sizes compared to other formats and aren’t capable of containing millions of colours. They can hold both text and transparent backgrounds, they are perfect for creating banners that intend to hold text on top of colours or images. They can be animated, meaning you can make moving images for your website such as an animated logo because they are raster based. 


2.6 error free pages that are fit for purpose

In order to to have error free pages fit for purpose I would constantly run and test the html pages in the browers and also try a number of different browsers to get a better perspective of how they look, to see if there’s continuity within the webpages, to make sure there’s no problems with any text or images or links used on each of the pages. Any alterations that would be made to the pages would need to be saved and then the adjusted html files would then have to be tested in the browsers all over again to make sure for regularities.
