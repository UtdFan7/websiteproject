    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>

    <p>
        There are 4 key motivations in helping to choose the precise technology needed for a particular project?:
they read about it online, hear that it’s reliable and like it;
they discover through statistics that this particular technology is a trend;
they know of a similar project built using this technology;
they have a friend who’s heard of it and advised them to use it. 
What’s the problem here?
You like it. This is very subjective. And what if, according to the requirements, it doesn’t fit?
Read about it. It takes time to figure out all the aspects, even for an expert with a strong basis in development – and without this, reading technical reviews is worth nothing.
My friend said it’s cool. This usually means someone “slightly better” versed in IT than you are, i.e. whose personal opinion is more valuable than yours. But even if he’s an expert programmer, nobody knows if he’s properly assessed every aspect of the project.
A similar website uses it. Most of the popular, mature apps share some approaches because integration with existing, out-of-date solutions demands some specific technologies. If Facebook was only now choosing which technology to use, it wouldn’t take PHP as its basis. For its time PHP seemed innovative, but now it’s a different story. Here is the chat on Quora with the same issue. The thing is, you can hardly know the real reasons behind the choice of technologies for other projects.
None of these methods are objective.
Below shows some inspiration on how best to pick the technology for your IT project.
List of objective criteria 
Size and type of the project and complexity of the tasks
Development speed as well as cost and availability of IT experts
Presence of development tools and ready-made solutions
Project flexibility and scalability
Technical requirements, existence of detailed documentation
Support costs
By choosing software technology according to such criteria, you can do the proper choice.
Correlation between type of the project and the technology to choose
Types of projects
We can try to make recommendations for the direction of development based on the size and complexity of a given task.
Usually, IT projects are divided into 3 groups:
Simple (business sites, landing pages, small online stores or applications) – such solutions are usually created with the help of CMS or ready-made templates.


Medium (complex online stores and marketplaces, national-scale portals, various SaaS, advanced applications) – such projects are usually built around frameworks.


Large (huge portals, social networks, innovative and non-trivial apps and integrated software systems) – the core of such projects is developed in a HL programming language.
