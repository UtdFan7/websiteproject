    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?

        In order to improve productivity in future assignments I would be a lot more organised and methodical in my approach, creating sketchbooks containing primiliminary ideas, research, visuals, texts etc etc. I would create even more detailed tabs in Trello, schedule tasks into even finer details than normal. Teamwork might be another avenue to go down with regards to improving productivity, by giving out jobs to people who specialise in certain areas then I get to work on a particular area I have a specialised skill in. I could make more use of Slack by emailing myself snippets of research interest to look over / ideas while at home, so every bit of time I have is used productively. It could also be used as a means of communication between team members if I decided to work collaboratively on future assignments.
