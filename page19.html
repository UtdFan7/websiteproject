        There are a number of different things that can be done to maximise productivity and efficiency of tackling different tasks. 

        Efficiency  - It is equally important to make short-term and long-term lists as it is to prioritise tasks.
        
        
        Delegate - Give responsibilities to team workers that have a proven track record with success in a certain field, and trust that they will perform the tasks well.
        
        
        Breaks - Take regular breaks from the screen to keep up concentration levels, inspire fresh ideas and also to keep headaches at bay. Keeping hydrated, eating and drinking healthy will also help to improve productivity and efficiency. 
        Health Body = Healthy Mind.
        
        
        Reduce Distractions - Social media can be a huge productivity killer, but it isn’t practical to have a no-phone policy. Instead, try to keep team workers focused and engaged while allowing them breathing room.
        Encourage teamworkers to turn off their mobiles but take regular breaks during which they can be free to check their phones. This will ensure that the time spent at their desk is more productive.
        Utilise Commute - Use this time as well as any time you may find on your hands to pound out some emails, create to-do list, or do some brainstorming.
