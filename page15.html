        I feel my website is ok as it answers the task in hand, but from a designers perspective I think it’s just run of the mill, does exactly what it says on the tin, from the uninitiated perspective they might think its good. The website functions well though, there’s a fluidity to the running of it and continuity throughout. It has a simple but effective layout and the colour scheme complements this.
 
Being a qualified designer I know I should have produced something a lot more inspirational and substantial, I’m very disappointed in myself to be honest, but with losing two relatives within the space of two weeks while on the course, it has shocked me somewhat and affected my focus, concentration, motivation as well as my design flair. My tutor Liam has been wonderful in the situation, very accommodating, always there to help.
